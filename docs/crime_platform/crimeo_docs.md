Crime IncidentsIntroductionCrime Incidents is a simple API for anyone to get crime incidents data from a specific location.For testing purposes we provide a limited public evaluation api-key: k3RAzKN1Ag14xTPlculT39RZb38LGgsG8n27ZycG, so you can try out the API call below. Also you can request a private api-key with increased limits and access to a release version here.Release Version 1The release version 1 provide access to 30+ cities across the US and LATAM (see section Coverage V1 for full list of cities).In this version we have 3 access points available, the first one is raw-data (that provides incidents raw data), the second one is stats (that provides incidents statistical information) and the third one is crowdsourced-raw-data (that provides crowdsourced incidents raw data from all the world) .Raw DataFor the raw-data access point in version 1 we use the FBI-NIBRS standard (more details below in the FBI-NIBRS section) and we offer the following output attributes for each incident:city_key City code in UN/LOCODE standardincident_code Incident code provided by the sourceincident_date Incident occurred date (approximate in some cases)incident_offense Incident offense type using FBI-NIBRS standardincident_offense_code Incident offense code using FBI-NIBRS standardincident_offense_description Incident offense sub type using FBI-NIBRS standardincident_offense_detail_description Incident detail descriptionincident_offense_crime_against Incident against Person/Property/Society/Not a Crimeincident_offense_action Incident action status (Commited/Attempted)incident_source_original_type Type of incident from the original sourceincident_source_name Incident source nameincident_latitude Incident Latitudeincident_longitude Incident Longitudeincident_address Incident address (approximate in some cases)For more information and use cases, see "Raw Data Version 1" in the Reference Section below.StatsThe access point stats is a new access point introduced in the version 1, currently only provides information about the total number of incidents, and the total number of incidents per type in a defined area and time period. The output attributes are:total_incidents Total number of incidentstype Incident offense descriptioncount Total number of incident by offense descriptionFor more information and use cases, see "Stats Version 1" in the Reference Section below.Crowdsourced Raw DataThe access point Crowdsourced Raw Data is a new access point introduced in the version 1, which provides access to crowdsourced incidents raw data from all the world. This information is collected from the community through CityCop app. The output attributes are:incident_code Incident code provided by the sourceincident_date Incident occurred dateincident_offense Incident offense type using FBI-NIBRS standardincident_offense_code Incident offense code using FBI-NIBRS standardincident_offense_description Incident offense sub type using FBI-NIBRS standardincident_offense_detail_description Incident detail descriptionincident_offense_crime_against Incident against Person/Property/Society/Not a Crimeincident_offense_action Incident action status (Commited/Attempted)incident_source_name Incident source nameincident_latitude Incident Latitudeincident_longitude Incident LongitudeFor more information and use cases, see "Crowdsourced Raw Data Version 1" in the Reference Section below.Coverage V1US: To know our latest coverage in raw-data please see "Raw Data Version 1 Coverage" in the Reference Section below.Some examples of cities that we cover in US are: Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Elgin, Evanston, Fresno, Fort Worth, Houston, Jacksonville, GrandRapids, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Plano, Raleigh, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Monica, Washington, Worcester.LATAM: Sao Paulo (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Santiago (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), León (Mexico) and others.FBI-NIBRSNational Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is a standard defined by the FBI to unify the format in which cities typify their crimes.We use NIBRS to standardize the original types of our sources to the most compatible NIBRS offenses, but in some cases it is difficult to find the perfect match, so we add new offenses types created by us (these types have the attribute incident_offense_code with value "N/A").You can review the full NIBRS technical Specification here and the NIBRS crime offenses definition here.
